	<!-- * We set [NULL] dynamically too. 
		 Here is explanation why first row of table has to contain columns with [NULL]s:
		 
		 DbUnit uses the first tag for a table to define the columns to be populated.
		 If the following records for this table contain extra columns,
		 these ones will therefore not be populated. To solve this, either define all the columns 
		 of the table in the first row (using NULL values for the empty columns), 
		 or use a DTD to define the metadata of the tables you use.
